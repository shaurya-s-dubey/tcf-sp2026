> 📢 We will set up 1 on 1s if you don’t do your homework or don’t show up to class without telling us

> This is for your benefit only—it’s not supposed to be intimidating. During the meeting, we’ll set up a plan which will best suit your own schedule and goals.

**Attendance**: You are expected to attend all the sessions you can, HOWEVER, we understand that there are a multitude of other responsibilities and priorities you guys have—as there should be—so the biggest responsibility you guys have regarding attendance is COMMUNICATION. We want to know what you’ll have to miss so that we can help you succeed!

📢 **If you have to miss a session:**

1. In a timely manner, create a group chat with the Tech Consulting Foundations Committee Members on Slack informing them you will not be able to make it.
2. Catch-up on what you missed by reviewing slides (that will be posted in this syllabus at Schedule & Curriculum) and homework. Ask classmates and instructors for questions, attending office hours to learn new concepts.
3. Do the homework and submit it by the following session, just like everyone else, unless you’ve spoken to the Tech Consulting Foundations Committee Members about an alternate plan to accommodate your situation.

**In-Class Participation**. Interact with your fellow classmates. Ask questions. Have fun with the material presented in class. We would love to hear your voice! Tech Consulting Foundations is an experience for you and we’ll need your help making it amazing.

> Please notify the Tech Consulting Foundation Committee Members in advance if you predict that you will not be able to finish a session’s homework. If you do not notify us that you will not be able to finish a session’s homework or if you develop a pattern of missing out from homework, we will set up a 1:1 to make sure you are getting all the help you need to have a successful time at Tech Consulting Foundations!

> **Asking for Help**: Asking for help is immensely encouraged! Please do not struggle alone on a topic or homework—reach out to students, instructors and go to office hours. Not only will this increase class cohesion, but it will lessen the load on you and help you learn better. A win-win!

> If you have a conceptual question where you are confused about what is taught, make sure to raise your hand and interrupt the instructor. This could be important for everyone to hear!
